## Day 4 – Subdomain Enumeration

### Overview
Subdomain enumeration is the process of discovering subdomains associated with a main domain. These subdomains often expose hidden services and increase the attack surface.

### Key Concepts
- What subdomains are and why they exist
- Forgotten admin, test, and staging environments
- Attack surface expansion through subdomains
- Importance of reconnaissance before exploitation

### Why This Matters
- Hidden subdomains often lack security updates
- They may expose admin panels or APIs
- Many real-world breaches start from weak subdomains

### Practical Example
Using a basic enumeration tool:
```bash
sublist3r -d example.com
