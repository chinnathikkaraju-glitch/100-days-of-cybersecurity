## Day 1 – Cybersecurity Fundamentals & Ethical Hacking

### Overview
Cybersecurity begins with understanding how systems work, not breaking them blindly. Ethical hackers rely on strong fundamentals before using any tools or exploits.

### Key Concepts Covered
- Difference between ethical hacking and illegal hacking
- What bug bounty programs really are
- Penetration testing vs random attacks
- Client-server architecture
- How data packets travel across networks
- Role of servers in modern applications

### Why This Matters
Without networking and system fundamentals:
- Vulnerability testing becomes guesswork
- Tools produce results you don’t understand
- Reports lack accuracy and credibility

### Practical Insight
When accessing a website:
1. Your browser sends an HTTP request
2. The request reaches a web server
3. The server processes it and responds
4. Security flaws often exist in this flow

Understanding this process is essential before learning any attack technique.
