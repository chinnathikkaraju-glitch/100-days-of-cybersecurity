## Day 2 – IP Addresses, DNS, Ports & Protocols

### Overview
Networking fundamentals are critical in cybersecurity. Every investigation, scan, or alert starts with understanding how systems communicate over the internet.

### Key Concepts
- IPv4 vs IPv6 addressing
- Public IP vs Private IP ranges
- Domain names and DNS resolution
- Common ports (80, 443, 22, 21)
- Protocols like HTTP, HTTPS, FTP, SSH

### Why This Matters
- IP addresses help trace attackers and suspicious activity
- DNS records reveal malicious domains and infrastructure
- Open or unusual ports may indicate misconfigurations or malware

### Practical Example
Check your system’s IP address:
```bash
ip a        # Linux
ipconfig   # Windows
