## Day 3 – WHOIS Lookup & OSINT Basics

### Overview
OSINT (Open-Source Intelligence) involves collecting publicly available information to support cybersecurity investigations. WHOIS is often the first step when analyzing domains.

### Key Concepts
- What WHOIS is and why it matters
- Domain registrar and hosting details
- Registration and expiry dates
- Name servers and infrastructure clues
- OSINT as a legal investigation method

### Why This Matters
- Helps identify phishing and scam websites
- Links multiple malicious domains together
- Preserves evidence even if a website is taken down
- Supports incident response and fraud investigations

### Practical Example
Perform a WHOIS lookup:
```bash
